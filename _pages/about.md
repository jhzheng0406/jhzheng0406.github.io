I am a first-year Master’s student in Computer Science at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch).

Previously, I received my undergraduate degree from the Department of Automation at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn), where I was advised by [Prof. Xiaolin Huang](http://www.pami.sjtu.edu.cn/en/xiaolin) at the Institute of Image Processing and Pattern Recognition.

During my undergraduate studies, I conducted summer research at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu) under the supervision of [Prof. Baharan Mirzasoleiman](https://baharanm.github.io/).

Currently, I am advised by [Prof. Alexandre Alahi](https://people.epfl.ch/alexandre.alahi?lang=en) and postdoctoral researcher [Wuyang Li](https://wymancv.github.io/wuyang.github.io/) at EPFL, where I work on video generation.

My research focuses on generative modeling, with a particular emphasis on video generation and efficient, scalable generative methods for real-world applications.

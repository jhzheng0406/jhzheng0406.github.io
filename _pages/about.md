I am now a first-year Master’s student in Computer Science at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch).  

Previously, I received my undergraduate degree from the Department of Automation at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn), where I was advised by [Prof. Xiaolin Huang](http://www.pami.sjtu.edu.cn/en/xiaolin) at the Institute of Image Processing and Pattern Recognition.

During my undergraduate studies, I conducted summer research at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu) under the supervision of [Prof. Baharan Mirzasoleiman](https://baharanm.github.io/).

Currently, I am advised by [Prof. Alexandre Alahi](https://people.epfl.ch/alexandre.alahi?lang=en) and postdoctoral researcher [Wuyang Li](https://wymancv.github.io/wuyang.github.io/) at EPFL, where I work on video generation.

My research focuses on generative modeling, with a particular emphasis on video generation and the development of efficient, scalable generative methods for real-world applications.

Research Experience
======
* Nov. 2024 -- June. 2025: Research Assistant
  * Project Name: Efficient Continual Learning for LLMs: A Parameter Sorting Approach to Mitigate Catastrophic Forgetting
    * Proposed a block-wise parameter sorting method to address catastrophic forgetting within a continual learning setting for large language models (LLMs).
    * Dynamically updated a subset of parameters to preserve performance on previous tasks while improving training efficiency compared to existing methods.
  * Advisor: **Xiaolin Huang,** Professor, Vice Dean, Department of Automation, SJTU
    
* July. 2024 -- May. 2025: Research Assistant
  * Project Name: Fewer Generated Images for Better Augmentation
    * Leveraged the GLIDE, a text-to-image model, with real guidance strategies to diversify the training datasets.
    * Conducted experiments on multiple datasets and across multiple architectures using upsampling and Diffusion-based data augmentation techniques.
    * Improved the classification accuracy by 1% than that without augmentation and training efficiency by 70% than 2x scale Diffusion-based data augmentation using selectively incorporating generated data.
  * Advisor: **Baharan Mirzasoleiman,** Assistant Professor, Computer Science Department, UCLA
 
* Mar. 2024 -- June. 2024: Co-author
  * Project Name: Unified Gradient-Based Machine Unlearning (MU) with Remain Geometry Enhancement
    * Proposed using KL divergence on the remaining output distribution, instead of Euclidean distance in vanilla methods, as the manifold metric to prevent deviations in the model output on the remaining set, improving MU performance.
    * Conducted experiments and parameter tuning to compare the performance of our algorithm with other MU methods in image classification and generation across various datasets and models of different architectures.
    * Improved the averaging disparity by 1.8% on average in random subset forgetting on CIFAR-10 in image classification and the FID by 80 on average in class-wish forgetting on ImageNet in image generation.
  * Advisor: **Xiaolin Huang,** Professor, Vice Dean, Department of Automation, SJTU
    
* Feb. 2024 -- June 2024: Sole Researcher
  * Project Name: Polyp Detection and Segmentation Augmented by Diffusion Model
    * Implemented yolov10 and ResUnet++ as baselines to finish object detection and segmentation on medical images.
    * Proposed using Diffusion-based generative models to generate synthetic data for data augmentation, which improved the mAP0.5@0.95 in the object detection by 1% and the IoU in the segmentation by 5%.
  * Advisor: **Manhua Liu,** Professor, Artificial Intelligence Research Institute, SJTU

* Oct. 2023 – Mar. 2024: Group Member
  * Project Name: Design of distributed collaborative positioning system
